# Deep-Learning
Introduction
Submit a report (5 - 10 pages, PDF format) for the following machine learning project. 
Explain briefly in the report the architectures that you used, how they were trained, tuned, etc. 
Describe challenges and problems and how they were addressed. 
Present in the report your experimental results and demos (e.g., screenshots) showing how your code works. 
Do not include code in the report, but include a link to a shared folder or repository (e.g. in Dropbox, GitHub, Bitbucket) containing your code. 
The project will contribute 40% to the final grade.

Fashion item recognition
Given an image of a fashion item, build a deep learning model that recognizes the fashion item. 
You must use at least 2 different architectures, one with MLPs and one with CNNs. Use the Fashion-MNIST dataset to train and evaluate your models. 
More information about the task and the dataset can be found at https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. 
The dataset is also available from Tensorflow and Keras.
